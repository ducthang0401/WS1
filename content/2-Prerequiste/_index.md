To learn how to create EC2 instances and VPCs with public/private subnets, you can refer to the lab:
  - [About Amazon EC2](https://000004.awsstudygroup.com/en/)
  - [Works with Amazon VPC](https://000003.awsstudygroup.com/en/)

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection to interact with the AWS Management Console and SSH into the EC2 instances.
- Once you've confirmed these preparations, you'll be ready to start the lab by signing into the AWS Management Console.
